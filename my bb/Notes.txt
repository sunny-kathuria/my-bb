Bug Bounty Hunting Guide for Absolute Beginners: -

Bug Hunting is a very vast field and there's a lot to study. So Beginners in this field are lacking proper guidance and appropriate study resources. So this small guide will provide you with the path on how to start and from where to study. So whatever I'm suggesting is my Experiences and my learnings. The guide is Completely Beginner friendly and I hope you may get something from it.

1. You don't have to directly jump into Bug Hunting. First, you have to clear your Basics. Learn Computer Fundamentals and all the Input and Output Operations.

2. You must have in-depth knowledge about the Internet and Networking that how connections are made, how the requests and HTTP Protocols works. You must have complete knowledge about the OSI model and all the TCP/IP Protocols.

3. After learning all those Stuff, you must familiar with various Operating Systems like Linux, Windows, Mac OS.

4. When your basic Concepts are clear, this is the time you need to learn various types of Vulnerabilities. For a deep understanding of the Bugs, you must Prefer a book called "Web Application Hacker's Handbook". The book is very beginner-friendly and it's like 'Bible' for Bug Hunters.

My Advice Before You Proceed - 

First, If you are a beginner in this field, then don't make Bug Hunting your full-time Carrier. First Join any Company and do bug hunting only part-time. You can make it a full-time career later. 

Second, you may face various problems like initially you not be able to find bugs but you won't have to lose hope. Patience is the key to success in this domain. Just keep doing practice and focus on learning.

XSS TIP:
This works in an app with logging enabled.
Try to put your blind payloads in headers like:
X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded
Forwarded
X-Real-IP
X-Client-IP
Servers try to get client IP from these which can appear in admin logs in raw. Try to forge errors for better results.
